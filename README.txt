RockPaperScissorsGame
=====================

The game consists of two players that input a set of symbols that adhere to a set of rules.

So there are 4 objects that we can represent in code:
1) The game
2) The input of symbols
2) The players (Human or Computer)
3) The rules of the game

The game object will be made of the other 3 objects so
I will start coding a way for the players to make their input known, the ReadInput class.
