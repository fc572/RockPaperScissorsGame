This is a Maven project, so choose this option when importing into 
you favourite IDE. (I have used Intellij)

Let maven import run freely and when it is done, 
build the project.

On the 	project LifeCycle, please run the test they should be all green.
(It works on my machine syndrome....)

In the package game there is a class called StartTheGame, the main method is in there.
To start the application just right click and select run StartTheGame.main()

Have fun!
